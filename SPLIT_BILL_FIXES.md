# Split Bill Functionality - Fixes Completed

## Summary
Fixed critical issues with the split bill functionality to improve multi-user experience, calculation accuracy, and real-time synchronization.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Split Method Visibility (WebSocket Synchronization)
**Problem**: When User A selected "Split Equally", User B couldn't see the change.

**Root Cause**: WebSocket event filtering was too restrictive, filtering out updates when `updatedBy === currentUser` OR `updatedUser === currentUser`.

**Fix**:
- **File**: `apps/customer/src/components/payment/SplitBillPayment.tsx` (lines 626-658)
- Changed filtering logic to:
  - For split method changes: ALL users see the update
  - For value changes: Skip only if current user made the update AND it's their own value
- This allows all users to see when someone changes the split method (EQUAL → BY_PERCENTAGE, etc.)

### 2. ✅ Remove Auto-Adjustment of Other Users' Values
**Problem**: When User A set their percentage to 50%, the backend auto-adjusted other users' percentages proportionally. This violated user expectations - each guest should only control their own percentage.

**Root Cause**: Backend `updateUserSplitAmount` function had logic to auto-distribute remaining percentage to other users.

**Fix**:
- **File**: `Tabsy-core/src/api/controllers/tableSessionController.ts` (lines 1593-1647)
- **BY_PERCENTAGE**: Each user can only update their own percentage
  - Removed auto-adjustment logic
  - Added validation: Total percentage must not exceed 100%
  - Returns error if validation fails (no auto-fix)
- **BY_AMOUNT**: Each user can only update their own amount
  - Removed auto-adjustment logic
  - Added validation: Total amount must not exceed remaining balance
  - Returns error if validation fails (no auto-fix)

### 3. ✅ Restrict Input Field Editing
**Problem**: Users could edit other users' percentage/amount input fields, which was confusing and incorrect.

**Fix**:
- **Files**:
  - `apps/customer/src/components/payment/SplitBillPayment.tsx` (lines 2294-2301, 2346-2353)
- Added `disabled={user.guestSessionId !== currentUser.guestSessionId || ...}` to input fields
- Users can now ONLY edit their own fields
- Other users' fields are visible but disabled (read-only)
- Added helpful tooltips: "You can only edit your own percentage/amount"

### 4. ✅ Visual User Identification
**Problem**: Users couldn't easily identify which row was theirs.

**Fix**:
- **Files**:
  - `apps/customer/src/components/payment/SplitBillPayment.tsx` (lines 2268-2279, 2330-2338)
- Added "You" badge next to current user's name
- Highlighted current user's row with primary color border and background
- Applied to both BY_PERCENTAGE and BY_AMOUNT sections

### 5. ✅ Real-time Validation Feedback
**Problem**: No clear feedback when percentages/amounts were invalid (exceeding limits or incomplete).

**Fix**:
- **File**: `apps/customer/src/components/payment/SplitBillPayment.tsx` (lines 2315-2355, 2412-2452)

**BY_PERCENTAGE Validation**:
- ❌ **Red Alert** if total > 100%: "Total percentage exceeds 100% • Please reduce by X%"
- ℹ️ **Blue Info** if total < 100%: "Incomplete split - X% remaining • $Y will remain unpaid"
- ✅ **Green Success** if total = 100%: "Perfect split - 100% covered"

**BY_AMOUNT Validation**:
- ❌ **Red Alert** if total > bill: "Total amount exceeds bill • Exceeds by $X"
- ℹ️ **Blue Info** if total < bill: "Incomplete split - $X remaining • This amount will remain unpaid"
- ✅ **Green Success** if total = bill: "Perfect split - Full bill covered"

### 6. ✅ Calculation Accuracy & Rounding
**Problem**: Potential rounding discrepancies between frontend and backend.

**Solution Already in Place**:
- Frontend always uses backend-calculated amounts when available (`backendSplitAmounts`)
- Both frontend and backend use consistent rounding: `Math.round(value * 100) / 100`
- Backend is source of truth for final amounts
- Frontend only calculates fallback values if backend amounts are unavailable

## Behavior Changes

### Before
1. User A selects "Split Equally" → User B doesn't see it ❌
2. User A sets 50% → Backend auto-adjusts User B to 50% ❌
3. Users can edit each other's percentages/amounts ❌
4. No way to know which row is yours ❌
5. No feedback on invalid splits ❌

### After
1. User A selects "Split Equally" → User B sees it immediately ✅
2. User A sets 50%, User B sets 30% → 20% remains unpaid (with clear notice) ✅
3. Users can ONLY edit their own values ✅
4. "You" badge clearly identifies current user ✅
5. Real-time validation with color-coded alerts ✅

## Testing Checklist

### Multi-User Split Method Change
- [ ] User A changes to "Split Equally" → Verify User B sees it
- [ ] User B changes to "BY_PERCENTAGE" → Verify User A sees it
- [ ] User C changes to "BY_AMOUNT" → Verify all users see it

### BY_PERCENTAGE Testing
- [ ] User A enters 50%, User B enters 30%
  - Verify shows "20% remaining - $X unpaid" (Blue info)
- [ ] User A enters 60%, User B enters 50%
  - Verify shows "Total 110% - reduce by 10%" (Red error)
  - Verify backend rejects on submit
- [ ] User A enters 60%, User B enters 40%
  - Verify shows "Perfect split - 100% covered" (Green success)

### BY_AMOUNT Testing
- [ ] Bill = $100, User A enters $40, User B enters $30
  - Verify shows "$30 remaining unpaid" (Blue info)
- [ ] Bill = $100, User A enters $60, User B enters $50
  - Verify shows "Exceeds by $10" (Red error)
  - Verify backend rejects on submit
- [ ] Bill = $100, User A enters $60, User B enters $40
  - Verify shows "Perfect split - Full bill covered" (Green success)

### Input Field Restrictions
- [ ] User A tries to edit User B's percentage → Field is disabled ✅
- [ ] User A tries to edit User B's amount → Field is disabled ✅
- [ ] User A can edit their own values → Works normally ✅
- [ ] Hover over disabled field → Shows tooltip "You can only edit your own percentage/amount" ✅

### Visual Identification
- [ ] Current user's row has "You" badge ✅
- [ ] Current user's row has primary color highlight ✅
- [ ] Other users' rows are normal style ✅

### WebSocket Synchronization
- [ ] 3+ users making concurrent changes
- [ ] All users see all updates correctly
- [ ] No duplicate or missing updates

### 7. ✅ WebSocket Split Method Synchronization
**Problem**: When User A changed split method from BY_PERCENTAGE to EQUAL, User B didn't see the change. UI would flicker with empty values.

**Root Cause**:
- Backend split amounts not always applied from WebSocket events
- Split method change detection using stale closure state
- Multiple rapid state updates causing flickering

**Fix**:
- **File**: `apps/customer/src/components/payment/SplitBillPayment.tsx` (lines 496-611)
- **Always update backend split amounts** when provided in WebSocket event
- **Clear input values when switching methods** to prevent flickering with old data
- When switching to EQUAL: Clear all percentages and amounts
- When switching to BY_PERCENTAGE: Initialize percentages from backend, clear amounts
- When switching to BY_AMOUNT: Initialize amounts from backend, clear percentages
- **Added detailed logging** to track split method changes (currentType vs incomingType)

## Files Modified

### Backend (Tabsy-core)
- `src/api/controllers/tableSessionController.ts`
  - Updated `updateUserSplitAmount` function (lines 1582-1652)
  - Removed auto-adjustment logic

### Frontend (Tabsy-Frontend)
- `apps/customer/src/components/payment/SplitBillPayment.tsx`

  - Added input field restrictions (lines 2294-2301, 2346-2353)
  - Added "You" badges and visual highlights (lines 2268-2279, 2330-2338)
  - Added validation feedback (lines 2315-2355, 2412-2452)

## Expected User Experience

### Scenario: 3-person dinner, $90 bill

#### User A (Alice)
1. Opens split bill screen
2. Sees "You" badge next to her name
3. Changes split method to "BY_PERCENTAGE"
4. Sets her percentage to 40%
5. Sees other users update their percentages in real-time
6. Cannot edit other users' fields
7. Sees live validation: "20% remaining - $18 unpaid"

#### User B (Bob)
1. Sees Alice change to "BY_PERCENTAGE" immediately
2. Sets his percentage to 35%
3. Sees Alice's 40% (read-only)
4. Sees validation update: "25% remaining - $22.50 unpaid"

#### User C (Carol)
1. Sees Alice's 40% and Bob's 35%
2. Sets her percentage to 25%
3. Sees validation: "Perfect split - 100% covered" ✅
4. All users can now proceed to payment

## Notes
- Rounding is handled consistently at 2 decimal places
- Backend is the source of truth for all calculations
- Frontend displays backend-calculated amounts
- WebSocket events ensure real-time synchronization
- All validation is duplicated on backend for security
