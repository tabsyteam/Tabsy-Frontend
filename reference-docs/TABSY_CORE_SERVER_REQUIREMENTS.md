# Tabsy Core Server Requirements

## Overview
The Tabsy Core Server provides the central business logic, data processing, and integration capabilities that power all three Tabsy applications (Customer, Restaurant, and Admin). It includes the main API server, WebSocket server for real-time communications, and serverless functions for asynchronous processing.

## Core Components

### 1. Main API Server
- Handles HTTP requests from all three applications
- Implements business logic and data validation
- Manages database interactions
- Processes authentication and authorization
- Integrates with third-party services
- Coordinates between different system components

### 2. WebSocket Server
- Manages real-time bi-directional communication between restaurant staff and customers
- Handles connection management, authentication, and scaling across multiple server instances
- Processes live updates for orders, tables, menus, and payments
- Facilitates POS integration synchronization through dedicated event channels
- Provides comprehensive event distribution system across all Tabsy applications
- Implemented with namespaces for restaurant staff (/restaurant) and customers (/customer)
- Organized with modular, dedicated handlers:
  - `orderHandler.ts` for real-time order processing and notifications
  - `tableHandler.ts` for table status and customer assistance
  - `menuHandler.ts` for menu updates and item availability
  - `paymentHandler.ts` (integrated in orderHandler) for payment events
  - `restaurantHandler.ts` for restaurant management events
  - `authHandler.ts` for authentication and session events
  - `notificationHandler.ts` for system-wide and targeted notifications
- Uses Redis adapter for distributed deployments and scalability
- Features robust error handling and reconnection strategies
- Complete implementation details in the [WebSocket Architecture](./WEBSOCKET_ARCHITECTURE.md) document

### 3. Serverless Functions
- Handles asynchronous processing tasks
- Processes image optimization and storage
- Manages notification delivery
- Handles webhook processing from payment providers
- Generates reports and exports
- Processes scheduled tasks and maintenance

## Technical Requirements
