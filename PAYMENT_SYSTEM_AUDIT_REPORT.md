## Use Case Analysis & Implementation Status

### 1. Single Guest - Same QR, Same Session ✅ FULLY SUPPORTED
**Expected Behavior:** One guest scans QR → creates sessions → orders → pays → session expires
**Current Implementation:** ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY
- Session creation works flawlessly with 3-hour timeout
- Order placement and payment processing is secure and reliable
- Automatic session cleanup after payment completion
- Proper client state cleanup post-payment

**Files Reviewed:**
- `apps/customer/src/components/payment/PaymentView.tsx:82-1145`
- `apps/customer/src/lib/session.ts` - SessionManager implementation

### 2. Two Guests - Same QR, Different Sessions, One Payer ⚠️ PARTIALLY SUPPORTED
**Expected Behavior:** Two guests join table → both order → Guest A pays for all orders
**Current Implementation:** ⚠️ WORKS BUT NEEDS ARCHITECTURE REFINEMENT

**How It Currently Works:**
- Each guest gets separate guest session within same table session
- Both guests can order simultaneously via WebSocket coordination
- Payment system finds all unpaid orders and processes them together
- Uses individual order payment endpoint as workaround for table-wide payment

**Issues Found:**
- No dedicated table-wide payment endpoint (uses order-based workaround)
- Complex logic to aggregate unpaid orders at payment time
- Could be cleaner with proper table session payment architecture

**Code Location:** `apps/customer/src/components/payment/PaymentView.tsx:436-497`

### 3. Two Guests - Sequential Separate Payments ✅ WORKING WITH MINOR ISSUES
**Expected Behavior:** Guest A orders & pays → Guest B orders & pays later
**Current Implementation:** ✅ MOSTLY WORKING

**Strengths:**
- System correctly tracks paid vs unpaid orders
- Previous payments don't interfere with new payments
- Session continues properly between payments
- Table session remains active for additional guests

**Minor Issues:**
- Bill display could better show payment history
- Session cleanup timing could be optimized

### 4. Two Guests - Split Payment Across Two Payers ✅ FULLY SUPPORTED
**Expected Behavior:** Both guests order → split the bill → each pays their portion
**Current Implementation:** ✅ EXCELLENT IMPLEMENTATION

**Features:**
- Sophisticated split payment UI with multiple methods:
  - Equal split
  - By items (assign items to specific users)
  - By percentage
  - By custom amounts
- Atomic split payment creation with proper rollback
- Real-time calculation of individual amounts
- Proper tax and tip distribution

**Code Location:** `apps/customer/src/components/payment/SplitBillPayment.tsx`

### 5. Two Guests - Simultaneous Payments ⚠️ PARTIALLY PROTECTED
**Expected Behavior:** Both guests attempt payment at exact same time
**Current Implementation:** ⚠️ GOOD PROTECTION BUT COULD BE ENHANCED

**Current Protection Mechanisms:**
- Stripe idempotency keys prevent duplicate charges
- Database transactions ensure atomic payment updates
- Duplicate payment detection before creation
- Session protection during payment processing

**Areas for Enhancement:**
- No application-level distributed locks for high-concurrency scenarios
- Could add Redis-based locking for additional protection
- Payment queue system for true simultaneous attempts

**Code Location:** Backend payment service with idempotency handling

### 6. New Guest After Payments Completed ✅ HANDLED WITH ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT
**Expected Behavior:** After payments, new guest scans QR → should get fresh experience
**Current Implementation:** ✅ WORKING WITH GRACE PERIOD LOGIC

**How It Works:**
- Table sessions have 30-minute grace period after payment completion
- New guests can reactivate existing sessions or create fresh ones
- Proper session cleanup prevents conflicts
- WebSocket notifications handle user presence

**Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Could improve new guest onboarding UX
- Better handling of session transition states

### 7. Session Expiry and Client State Management ⚠️ NEEDS REFINEMENT
**Expected Behavior:** After payment/navigation, clear stale session state and refetch current state
**Current Implementation:** ⚠️ RECOVERY EXISTS BUT NEEDS UX POLISH

**Current Features:**
- Comprehensive session recovery mechanisms
- Multiple fallback authentication methods
- Automatic session state validation
- Browser storage cleanup on expiry

**Issues Found:**
- Client doesn't always immediately clear stale localStorage
- Multiple recovery attempts can confuse users
- Need stronger cache invalidation after payment

**Code Location:** `apps/customer/src/components/payment/PaymentView.tsx:347-400`

---

## Detailed Issues Found & Recommendations

### 🔴 High Priority Issues

#### 1. Table Session Payment Architecture
**Issue:** Current implementation uses individual order payments as workaround for table-wide payments.

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// PaymentView.tsx:436-497 - Complex logic to find unpaid orders
const unpaidOrders = []
for (const order of allOrders) {
  const paymentsResponse = await api.payment.getByOrder(order.orderId)
  // Complex aggregation logic...
}
```

**Impact:** Unnecessary complexity, potential for missed orders, not scalable
**Recommendation:** Implement dedicated table session payment endpoint
**Priority:** HIGH - Affects core payment functionality

#### 2. Session State Synchronization
**Issue:** Client may retain stale session data after payment completion.

**Evidence:** Session recovery logic in PaymentView.tsx:347-400 attempts multiple fallbacks
**Impact:** User confusion, potential payment errors
**Recommendation:** Implement session versioning and forced refresh
**Priority:** HIGH - Affects user experience

#### 3. Concurrent Payment Race Conditions
**Issue:** No application-level locks for truly simultaneous payments.

**Evidence:** Only database constraints and Stripe idempotency prevent issues
**Impact:** Potential payment conflicts in high-traffic scenarios
**Recommendation:** Add Redis-based distributed locks
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Critical for busy restaurants

### 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

#### 4. Split Payment Edge Cases
**Issue:** User leaving during split payment process not fully handled.

**Evidence:** SplitBillPayment component doesn't handle user disconnection gracefully
**Impact:** Remaining users may be unable to complete payment
**Recommendation:** Add graceful degradation for user departure
**Priority:** MEDIUM

#### 5. Session Recovery UX
**Issue:** Multiple recovery attempts can confuse users.

**Evidence:** Complex retry logic with multiple toast notifications
**Impact:** Poor user experience during session issues
**Recommendation:** Simplify recovery flow with clear messaging
**Priority:** MEDIUM
